# Screensaver
This is my screensaver for my creative coding class! I went on a family trip to Paris with my family a couple of years back, and I distinctly remember being in the city at night, surrounded by all of the colorful lights. When I was looking at them, I remember how they all started to blur together, as a mix of the car headlights, neon signs, and fairy lights. I wanted to achieve a similar effect in my screensaver, with lots of circular blurs of color and areas of brightness.  I experimented with multiple components like the speed, size, and color of the circles, and ended up with a result that I felt represented my memory of Paris. To get more inspiration, I was looking through other classmates' trial and errors, and I got a lot of inspiration from one classmate, Justin Mundie. His design reminded me of my trip to Paris, and I changed it in a lot of ways to fit my own vision.
