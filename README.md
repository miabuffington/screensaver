# screensaver
This is my screensaver for my creative coding class! I went on a family trip to Paris with my family a couple of years back, and I distinctly remember being in the city at night, surrounded by all of the colorful lights. When I was looking at them, I remember how they all started to blur together, as a mix of the car headlights, neon signs, and fairy lights. I wanted to achieve a similar effect in my screensaver, with lots of circular blurs of color and areas of brightness.  I experimented with multiple components like the speed, size, and color of the circles, and ended up with a result that I felt represented my memory of Paris.
